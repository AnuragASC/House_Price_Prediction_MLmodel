# House Price Prediction ML Model

Welcome to the House Price Prediction ML Model repository! This project showcases the development of a machine learning model for predicting house prices using Python and the scikit-learn library. By generating synthetic data, training a Linear Regression model, and evaluating its performance, this repository provides insights into the process of building a predictive model for real estate applications.

# Introduction

Predicting house prices is a critical challenge in the real estate industry. A multitude of factors, such as location, size, features, and market trends, influence the price of a house. This project aims to provide a simplified demonstration of how machine learning techniques can be utilized to predict house prices based on various features.

# Data Generation

To facilitate the model's development, synthetic house price data is generated. The dataset consists of 1000 samples, each containing 5 randomly generated features. These features represent attributes that can impact a house's value. Coefficients are assigned to each feature to establish a relationship with the target variable (house price). Additionally, a controlled amount of random noise is introduced to the target variable to simulate real-world variability.

# Model Building

The core of this project lies in building a predictive model using the Linear Regression algorithm. Linear Regression is a fundamental machine learning technique that assumes a linear relationship between input features and the target variable. The scikit-learn library is utilized to create and train the Linear Regression model on the synthetic house price dataset.

# Evaluation and Visualization

The model's effectiveness is assessed using the Mean Squared Error (MSE) metric. The MSE quantifies the accuracy of the model's predictions. Furthermore, cross-validation is employed to evaluate how well the model generalizes to unseen data.

In addition to quantitative evaluation, the repository includes visualization components. Sample predictions and actual house prices are plotted against different features, showcasing the model's performance visually. This allows for an intuitive understanding of how well the model captures the underlying patterns in the data.
